    "The worshiper never considers usurpation. And that is why Beethoven's place in the pantheon is secure. He inspired worship. But the type-I artist who reveres without worshiping will, ultimately, usurp his forebears. And once senses a dwindling regard of the forebear as this artists reputation grows.\n",
