# worship

Reverence isn't the same as ancestral worship. Ludwig inspired worship rather than the spirit of reverence of forebears in the totality of their lineage. Thus the 19th century witnesses geniuses, showmen, and the like -- who had no ancestors: Wagner, Liszt, etc.

Chopin must never be included in this list. His tributes to Polish folklore say it all.
