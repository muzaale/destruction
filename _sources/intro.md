# artists

There are artists who use the work of their forebears as a scaffolding on which to harness their delicate ideas. Musicians come to mind since their medium in its purest form is nothing more than cosmic chaos. Only a dedicated lineage of artists over millenia could have made possible what we call music today. In my opinion, it is mans purest and greatest creation. We cannot attribute it to the gods or any other odds other than the cause, the will, the strength, and the means of this delicate species.

And then there are artists who see their "great" forebears as having feet of clay. These artists create from the ruins they leave in the wake of their irreverant and destructive approach to things. An ancestor may suppose they bequithed a great work of architectural grandeur to posterity. But this type-II artist only sees a source of bricks and building blocks for something harder, stronger, faster, better. Philospher-artists dominate this space, with their attack on all the metaphysics that has cancerously grown through to their time.
